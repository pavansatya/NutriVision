<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

## NutriWeb

NutriWeb is an intelligent food recommendation platform designed to enhance dietary choices by providing **personalized insights, transparency, and sustainability tracking**. Unlike existing apps that offer generic ratings, NutriWeb tailors recommendations based on **BMI, allergies, and dietary goals**, while also highlighting the **environmental impact** of food choices.

### **Problem Statement:**
Current nutrition apps **lack clarity, personalization, and sustainability awareness**:
- **Confusing information:** Complex ingredient lists make it hard to understand nutritional values.
- **Lack of personalization:** Generic health scores fail to consider individual dietary needs.
- **Environmental ignorance:** Most apps overlook the carbon footprint and eco-impact of food choices.

### **Solution: NutriWebâ€™s Unique Approach**
NutriWeb integrates **Personalized Nutrition analysis, visual comparisons, and context-aware insights** to help users make **smarter food choices**:
- **Personalized nutrition** based on user profiles (BMI, allergies, health goals).
- **Ingredient transparency** with easy-to-understand visual comparisons.
- **Sustainability tracking** to highlight a productâ€™s carbon footprint.

## Dataset
1) **Open Food Facts:** Crowdsourced database with 3M+ food products.

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SrVPakdOvOkUEsJekmsl9786MrxWXH0g/view?usp=sharing).

A food products database
Open Food Facts is a free, open, collaborative database of food products worldwide, with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the tidbits of information we can find on product labels.

Made by everyone
Open Food Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.
5000+ contributors like you have added 600 000+ products from 150 countries using our Android, iPhone or Windows Phone app or their camera to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.

For everyone
Data about food is of public interest and has to be open. The [complete database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) is published as open data and can be reused by anyone and for any use. Check out the cool reuses or make your own!

The dataset contains a single table, FoodFacts, in a tab-separated form in en.openfoodfacts.org.products.tsv
